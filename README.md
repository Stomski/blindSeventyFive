# blindSeventyFive

## a study of the blind 75 and working solutions, working through them as tech interview practice

### steps for any answer:

### planning:

ask good clarifying questions
inputs outputs
confirm assumptions
formulate our approach, brainstorm/analyze
pseudocode

### execution phase:

coding, fairly fast
example input and output
big O explanation

---

## stacks and queues

stack is depth first search

    push, pop, peak, is empty

queue is a breadth first search, was developed before the stack

    enqueue, dequeue, peak, is empty
