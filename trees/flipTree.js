Invert/Flip Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

Example 1:


Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

Example 2:


Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

function invertBinTreeIterative(root) {
  // i consider this one pretty straight forward
}

function invertBinTreeRecursive(root) {
  //so honestly this is the one that for sure gives me trouble, so lets psudo code it out a bit.....
}
