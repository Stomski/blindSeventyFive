different types of trees

binary/n-ary trees

binary search tree, they are ordered

heap is a type of tree, there are some within the blind 75

key operations:

insertion deletion traversal search

in order pre order post order traversal, all depth first seach,

level order traversal is BFT

log n for insertion of binary search tree, On for other kinds,

traversal is typically On

common use cases:

hierarchichal data,

searching and sorting/ storing sorted data

spellcheck systems, priority cues (heaps) use trees under the hood as well

BFS

O(n)

O(k) where width of the widest row of the tree
