/*

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.



Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.


ok so iterate over the strings, building a hashmap for each string that tracks unique characters and their counts
if at any point those hashmaps dont equal each other return ffalse, if we get to the end return true


but how does that hashmap work?
