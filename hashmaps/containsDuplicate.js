Duplicate Integer

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]

Output: true

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: false


potential naive approach would be to use a double loop iteration, this honestly is what was obvious to me, second option took me a few seconds hahaaaaaa fuck

optimized solution, is iterate through it and add it to an object, if it already exists in the object, return true
